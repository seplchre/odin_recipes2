Today I'm finally going to finish my first website in HTML. It's baby
steps, soon I will do better and bigger things. I hope that I can also
finish the CSS lesson today, but we will see if my concentration holds. 
I'm going to be putting together some recipes of mine in full formatting,
written from scratch. I will put CSS on it later. I hope you enjoy.
