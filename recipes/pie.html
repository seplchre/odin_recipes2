                <h4>Triple spiced and definitely owns a goddamn AR-15</h4>
                    <p>
                        Listen, you can make your low brow and <em>peculiar</em> ethnic <em><strong>cuisine</strong></em>,
                        and I say that with too much respect. But this? This blows everything else out of the water.
                        Even a juicy, thick <strong>steak</strong>. There is so much spice inside that you couldn't help
                        but to think fondly on our European conquest throughout the West Indies. This is the pie sitting on
                        the windowsill in the cartoons.

                    <p>
                        It is best to use <em>fresh apples</em>, picked from a local orchard. Your spices should most definitely be sourced fresh from source,
                        including the <em>ginger</em>. A major tip that when ignored leads to frustration and <strong>waste of time</strong>, is that you most definitely
                        should use some sort <em>automatic apple peeler</em>. Be careful with this one, you may just eat the whole thing.

                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                    <ul>
                       <li>From-Scratch Pie Dough</li>
                       <li>4 to 4 1/2 pounds of baking apples (Fuji, Honeycrisp, Granny Smith, Pink Delight)</li>
                       <li>1/2 cup light or dark brown sugar</li>
                       <li>1/2 cup cane sugar</li>

                       <li>1 teaspoon Ceylon cinnamon</li>
                       <li>1/4 teaspoon fresh from source ginger</li>
                       <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
                       <li>1/4 teaspoon allspice</li>
                       <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
                       <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch or 4 tablespoons tapioca flour/starch</li>
                       <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
                       <li>1 egg</li>
                    </ul>
                
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <h3>Make Apple Filling</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Peel, and then cut the apples in half. Remove the cores, and then slice apple halves into thin slices, about 1/4-inch thick. Place the apple slices into a very large bowl.</li>
                            <li>Scatter both sugars, salt, and spices over the apples, and then use your hands to toss them, coating the apple slices as much as possible. Set aside for 1 hour at room temperature.</li>
                        </ol>
                    <h3>Assemble Pie</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Take your pie dough out of the fridge for about 15 minutes before rolling it out. Place the dough into a buttered up 9 inch pie pan</li>
                            <li>Preheat the oven to 400F</li>
                            <li>Toss cornstarch (or tapioca) with the apples. Transfer most (if not all) of the apples into the prepared bottom crust, using your hands to really pack them down into the pie. Fill the pie until apples are mounded at the same height or a little higher as the edge of the pie crust, tucking in as many as you can. If you have too many apples, save them </li>
                            <li>Pour the juices that have accumulated at the bottom of the bowl over the apples. Cut a tablespoon of butter into 8 or so small pieces and dot them over the pie.</li>
                            <li>Whisk the egg with a tablespoon of water, and then use it as an egg wash by lightly brushing the top crust. This adds shine and helps the crust brown.</li>
                            <li>Place the prepared pie onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper (this can be the same lined baking sheet used for chilling the top crust). Bake the pie for about 75 minutes at 400F, turning a few times for even browning.</li>
                            <li>Apple pie is done when the juices are bubbling through the vents of the top crust or lattice. If you do not see bubbles, the pie needs more time. Another way to check for doneness is to use an internal thermometer. Pierce the pie in the middle then test the temperature. The pie is done when it reads 195 degrees Fahrenheit (90C). Piercing the pie is also a nice indication of how soft the apples are. If they feel too crunchy, the pie needs more time.</li>
                            <li>Be sure to cool the pie, without slicing into it, for at least 1 hour, preferably longer. Keep in mind that the pie filling does not fully thicken until it is completely cooled. So, for the absolute best results, cool the pie to room temperature, and then place it into the refrigerator for an hour or two. Waiting to cut into the pie until cool will prevent a soggy slice.</li>
                        </ol>
                    <h3>Storage And Leftovers</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Leftover pie will keep, at room temperature, for 2 to 3 days or in the refrigerator up to a week. Rewarm slices in a 350 degree Fahrenheit oven for 5 to 10 minutes before serving them.</li>
                        </ol>
