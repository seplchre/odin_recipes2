                <h4>The finished product</h4>
                    <p>Now <em>this</em> is something to rave about.
                        Rarely is a cheesecake made with such care and
                        delicacy that even the graham cracker crust it
                        is made with has been made directly from scratch.
                        A <strong><em>true chef</em></strong> knows when to
                        combine world class ingredients with a <em>magic touch</em>
                    </p>

                    <p>Some will insist that the cheesecake is just <strong>too good</strong>
                       to even <em>be sold</em>. But others say that $15 a slice is a fair 
                       price to pay for a hard to find taste, for all of history even. The best
                       thing about all of this? You can make it yourself! 
                    </p>

                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>32 oz Philadelphia cream cheese (softened to room temperature)</li>
                        <li>1 cup of cane sugar</li>
                        <li>2/3 cup of sour cream</li>
                        <li>2 teaspoons of fresh lemon juice</li>
                        <li>2 teaspoons Madagascar vanilla extract</li>
                        <li>1/8 teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg</li>
                        <li>1/8 teaspoon Himalaya pink salt</li>
                        <li>4 large eggs (room temperature, lightly beaten)</li>
                        <li>From Scratch Graham Cracker Crust</li>
                    </ul>
                
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat oven to 325F</li>
                        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl (using a hand mixer) add cream cheese and stir until smooth and creamy (don’t over-beat or you’ll incorporate too much air).</li>
                        <li>Add sugar and stir again until creamy.</li>
                        <li>Add sour cream, vanilla extract, nutmeg, lemon juice, and salt and stir until well-combined. If using a stand mixer, make sure you pause periodically to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a spatula so that all ingredients are evenly incorporated.</li>
                        <li>With mixer on low speed, gradually add lightly beaten eggs, one at a time, stirring just until each egg is just incorporated. Once all eggs have been added, use a spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl again and make sure all ingredients are well combined.</li>
                        <li>Pour cheesecake batter into prepared springform pan. To insure against leaks, place pan on a cookie sheet that’s been lined with foil.</li>
                        <li>Transfer to the center rack of your oven and bake on 325F for 50-60 minutes. Edges will likely have slightly puffed and may have just begun to turn a light golden brown and the center should spring back to the touch but will still be Jello-jiggly. Don't over-bake or the texture will suffer, which means we all suffer.</li>
                        <li>Remove from oven and allow to cool on top of the oven for 10 minutes. Once 10 minutes has passed, use a knife to gently loosen the crust from the inside of the springform pan (this will help prevent cracks as your cheesecake cools and shrinks). Do not remove the ring of the springform pan.</li>
                        <li>Allow cheesecake to cool another 1-2 hours or until near room temperature before transferring to refrigerator and allowing to cool overnight or at least 6 hours. I remove the ring of the springform pan just before serving then return it to the pan to store. Enjoy!</li>
